An operating system I build as a hobby!

# Some Highlights
- Written in C++
- Does not rely on 3rd party bootloader like GRUB
- Support paging
- Support multiprocessing
- Support a simple filesystem similar to ext2

# Future plans
- Support a user space shell
- Support networking
- Support assembler/compiler/linker (either write myself or porting existing ones)
