# Try various linux distributions

## Debian
Obtain the USB installation image from [here](https://www.debian.org/CD/). Note on i386 and amd64 arch, all CD/DVD debian images can be used on a USB stick too.

This is the distribution I finally boot from the kernel I built from source.

## Centos
Download the usb image [here](https://mirrors.vcea.wsu.edu/centos/7.9.2009/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-2009.iso).

Follow installation guide [here](https://docs.centos.org/en-US/centos/install-guide/Simple_Installation/).

## Ubuntu
The official website provide usb image to install both the desktop (with UI) version and server (without UI) version.
