# Reference
- [Linux IP Networking](https://www.cs.unh.edu/cnrg/people/gherrin/linux-net.html)
  - The doc describes tcp/ip stack in linux
  - Overvall it looks pretty nice! One issue is for tcp/udp connect/send/recv, the doc just gives a simple description and then list relevant functions. It can do better by showing how these functions works together.
  - skip the following chapters for now:
    - ch8: Basic Internet Protocol Routing
    - ch9: Dynamic Rounting with routed
