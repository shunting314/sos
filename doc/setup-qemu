# Simulate x86_64
The installed qemu comes with multiple executables one for each supported processors. For x86_64, the executable name is `qemu-system-x86_64`.

Use `-hda` option to specify the boot image. Here is an example command:
```
  qemu-system-x86_64 -hda out/boot/hello.bl
```
This is also the command used in `boot/Makefile` to launch qemu.
