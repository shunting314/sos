  - There are 2 fixed ports for PCI: 0xCF8 `CONFIG_ADDREES`, 0xCFC `CONFIG_DATA`. A configuration register access transction includes 2 steps: write the address encoding bus number, device number, function number and configuration register index to the `CONFIG_ADDRESS` port; then read or write a 4 bytes word from the `CONFIG_DATA` port.
  - The PCI configuration registers must be accessed as a whole word (4 bytes). Software should do necessary bit operations if only partial of a word is needed. This implies that the lowest 2 bits of the address written to the `CONFIG_ADDRESS` port must be 0.
  - PCI devices are inherently little-endian. big-endian processors like Power PC need perform the proper byte-swapping of data read from or written to the PCI device.
  - Vendor id 0xFFFF is invalid. Hardware returns all 1 bits for reading configuration registers of non-exist functions. Checking the returned vendor id against 0xFFFF can be used to detect if the function exists. PCI-SIG maintains the list of registered vendor ids [here](https://pcisig.com/membership/member-companies).
  - NOTE: it's necessary to check the highest bit of header type byte for function 0 to determine if the current device is a multi-function device. Some single-function devices may report details for 'function 0' for every function.

- [How is a PCI/PCIe BAR size determined - StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19006632/how-is-a-pci-pcie-bar-size-determined)
  - the answer assumes memory space BAR since the calculation masks the lowest 4 bits (IO space BAR need mask the lowest 2 bits).
