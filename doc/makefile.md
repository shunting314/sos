# Reference
- [make - wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)): Check the last example about handling the dependencies between a object file and header files included in the corresponding C file.
- [Makefile Tutorial](https://makefiletutorial.com/): the 'Makefile Cookbook' at the end worth read carefully!
- [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html): The official manual of GNU make. It's so long that I don't plan to read every section but instead use it as a reference.
