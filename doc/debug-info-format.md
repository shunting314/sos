# Note
- Enabling -g cause kernel elf file size increasing from 172k to 439k. We should move debug info to separate files and put that in the filesystem. They can be loaded by the kernel later rather than being loaded by BIOS.

- gcc/g++ generate debug information in DWARF V5 format by default as I wrote this.
