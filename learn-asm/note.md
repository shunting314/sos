# Compile a C File to an Assembly File
Use command `clang -S` to compile a C file to an assembly file.

# Assembly Syntax
There are 2 different x86 assembly syntaxes: Intel syntax and AT&T syntax. Check [x86 assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language) wiki for more details.

# Note
- By default, gcc and clang generates AT&T syntax assembly.
